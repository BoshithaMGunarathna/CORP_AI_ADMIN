# Unused JSX Files Analysis Report
# Generated on: 2025-08-06T09:49:14.123Z
# Total JSX files analyzed: 78
# Unused JSX files found: 6

## Summary
After analyzing all JSX files in the repository and tracking import dependencies, the following files appear to be unused:

## Unused JSX Files
1. src/components/dashboardComponents/SupplierCredits.jsx
2. src/components/layouts/Loader.jsx  
3. src/components/layouts/Logo.jsx
4. src/pages/account/Account.jsx
5. src/pages/stocks/AddDamageNote.jsx
6. src/pages/stocks/ItemCategoryManager.jsx

## Analysis Method
The analysis was performed by:
1. Scanning all JSX files in the project (78 total)
2. Parsing import statements to build a dependency graph
3. Starting from entry points (main.jsx, router.jsx) and following imports
4. Using case-insensitive matching to handle potential case mismatches
5. Identifying files that are not imported anywhere

## Import Issues Found
During the analysis, a case sensitivity issue was discovered in the router:
- File: src/routes/router.jsx line 21
- Issue: Import path "../pages/reports/Stockcard" should be "../pages/reports/StockCard"
- This causes build failures in case-sensitive environments

## Verification
- Build test confirmed the import path issue exists
- Manual grep searches confirmed no usage of the listed unused files
- All identified files have valid JSX content but are not referenced in the application

## Recommendation
The 6 unused JSX files can likely be safely removed from the codebase to reduce project size and maintenance overhead. However, consider:
1. Checking if these files are intended for future features
2. Verifying they're not used in any dynamic imports or non-standard ways
3. Testing thoroughly after removal to ensure no runtime issues
